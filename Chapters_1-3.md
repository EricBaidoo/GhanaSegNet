1.1 Background and Motivation

The challenges of food security and nutritional assessment remain pressing issues in developing regions, particularly in West Africa. Ghana’s rich and varied culinary traditions present a unique challenge for current computer vision systems, which often fail to accurately recognize complex traditional dishes because of biases in Westerncentric training datasets. This lack of culturally relevant AI systems exacerbates health disparities and impedes the advancement of digital health solutions in areas where they are most urgently required (Aslan et al., 2020; Dalakleidi et al., 2022). On a global scale, the automation of dietary monitoring is becoming increasingly crucial for public health, chronic disease management, and nutritional research (Chopra & Purwar, 2021). Nevertheless, the predominant AI food recognition systems are trained on Western datasets, such as Food101 and Recipe1M, leading to significant cultural bias and excluding over 1.4 billion Africans from accessing automated nutritional assessment technologies. This technological shortfall constitutes a form of algorithmic bias, perpetuating inequities in health and technology access (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018).

1.2 Problem Definition and Scope
Food recognition systems in African contexts face several technical and societal challenges. Technically, there is a scarcity of labeled data for traditional African cuisines, which represent less than 0.1% of existing food datasets. The presentation of traditional meals introduces complex and irregular food boundaries and texture similarities among different food types, whereas the spatial relationships between meal components add further contextual complexity. Additionally, computational constraints for mobile deployment in resourcelimited environments and severe class imbalances between food categories and backgrounds hinder the effectiveness of these systems. Societally, the lack of automated nutritional assessment tools for 54 African countries, limited public health data collection in developing regions, and technological colonialism in AI system design and deployment result in missed opportunities for scalable mHealth interventions.

1.3 Research Questions and Hypotheses
This research is guided by the primary question: How can we develop a culturally aware, multiscale transfer learning framework that achieves stateoftheart segmentation performance on traditional Ghanaian foods while remaining efficient for mobile deployment? The secondary questions include whether multistage transfer learning (ImageNet → Food Domain → African Cuisine → Ghanaian Foods) can outperform standard single stage transfer, what hybrid CNN-Transformer architectural innovations best support food segmentation, how food-aware loss functions address irregular boundaries and cultural presentation styles, and what deployment strategies ensure real-world applicability in resource constrained environments. The hypotheses posit that multistage transfer learning will achieve 15–25% mIoU improvement over single stage transfer, multiscale transformer integration will outperform single bottleneck attention by 10–15%, food-aware loss functions will demonstrate superior boundary preservation compared to standard losses, and cultural bias analysis will reveal significant performance disparities that our approach addresses.

Summary: GhanaSegNet seeks to bridge both the technical and societal divides in food segmentation within the African context, prioritizing fairness, efficiency, and meaningful real-world applications.

Literature Review and Research Gap Analysis

2.0 Definition of Semantic Segmentation
Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves classifying each pixel in an image into a predefined category, thereby producing a dense, pixel-wise labeling of the entire image (Long et al., 2015; Ronneberger et al., 2015). Unlike image classification, which assigns a single label to an entire image, semantic segmentation provides detailed spatial information by distinguishing between different objects and regions within the scene. For example, in the context of Ghanaian food images, semantic segmentation enables the model to identify and delineate rice, protein, vegetables, and sauce within a single meal photograph, assigning each pixel to its respective food class. This pixel-level understanding is crucial for accurate nutritional assessment and cultural representation in automated systems.

2.1 Evolution of Semantic Segmentation Architectures
Semantic segmentation has evolved through several key phases. The convolutional era, spanning 2015 to 2020, saw the development of fully convolutional networks for dense prediction (Long et al., 2015), encoder-decoder architectures with skip connections such as U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015), and the DeepLab series which introduced atrous convolutions for multi-scale feature extraction (Chen et al., 2018). The attention revolution from 2020 to 2022 brought transformer-based models for image understanding (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), CNN-Transformer hybrids like TransUNet (Chen et al., 2021), and efficient transformer designs such as SegFormer (Xie et al., 2021), which achieved state-of-the-art results. More recently, the focus has shifted to efficiency, with mobile-optimized architectures like MobileNets and EfficientNet-Lite (Tan & Le, 2019), knowledge distillation for efficient model transfer (Hinton et al., 2015), and neural architecture search for balancing accuracy and efficiency. Knowledge distillation refers to the process of transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, efficient model (student), while neural architecture search is an automated method for discovering optimal model structures. Advances in transformer-based segmentation (Yu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021) and mobile optimization have enabled deployment in resource-constrained environments, but most models remain Western-centric in their training data and evaluation.


2.2 Food Image Analysis: Current State and Limitations
The analysis of food images for computer vision applications is heavily influenced by the available datasets. Food-101 (Bossard et al., 2014) contains 101 categories and 75,750 images, with 90% representing Western cuisine. Recipe1M (Salvador et al., 2017) offers over a million images paired with recipes, but is also predominantly North American and European. Nutrition5k (Thames et al., 2021) provides nutritional annotations but has limited cultural diversity, and FoodSeg103 is segmentation-focused but includes minimal African representation. Systematic reviews reveal that less than 2% of African cuisine is represented across major food datasets, leading to algorithmic bias that affects over 1.4 billion people (Chopra & Purwar, 2021; Dalakleidi et al., 2022). This bias impacts segmentation accuracy, boundary detection, and the real-world applicability of models in African contexts.


2.3 Transfer Learning in Computer Vision
Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern computer vision. Single-stage transfer learning, typically involving ImageNet pretraining, is standard for natural image tasks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), but suffers from domain gap challenges and limited adaptation when the source and target domains differ. The domain gap refers to the difference in data distribution between the source (e.g., ImageNet) and target (e.g., Ghanaian food images) domains, which can lead to reduced model performance. Multi-stage transfer learning, as proposed in this work, involves progressive domain adaptation from ImageNet to food domain, then to cultural specificity and finally to the target application. Each stage refines hierarchical features and improves generalization, especially when handling limited target data (Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Tan & Le, 2019). Hierarchical features are representations learned at multiple levels of abstraction, from simple edges to complex objects. Self-supervised learning approaches, including contrastive learning (SimCLR, SwAV), masked image modeling (MAE, BEiT), and multi-modal learning for recipe-image alignment, further enhance the ability to learn robust representations for food imagery.


2.4 Mobile Deployment and Edge Computing
Mobile deployment of segmentation models requires careful consideration of efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Techniques such as model compression (quantization, pruning, distillation), architecture optimization for mobile-specific designs, and hardware awareness (ARM optimization, edge TPU compatibility) are essential. Quantization reduces model size and speeds up inference by representing weights with lower precision, while pruning removes unnecessary parameters. In developing regions, deployment is challenged by limited processing power, memory, and battery life, as well as the need for offline capability and cultural adaptation, including local language support and sensitivity to cultural context.

In summary, the advancement of semantic segmentation architectures has facilitated the development of models that are increasingly accurate and efficient. However, cultural bias in training data continues to pose a significant challenge to their global applicability. Consequently, the absence of culturally diverse food datasets constitutes a major impediment to achieving fair and accurate food segmentation in African contexts. In conclusion, multi-stage transfer learning and self-supervised approaches present promising solutions for adapting models to culturally specific food segmentation tasks. The existing literature underscores the lack of African representation in food datasets and models, highlighting the necessity for culturally aware and efficient segmentation frameworks for real-world deployment.

Proposed Methodology: GhanaSegNet Framework

3.1 Overall Architecture Philosophy
GhanaSegNet introduces a paradigm shift from single stage transfer learning to a multiscale, culturally aware framework. The approach integrates progressive domain adaptation, a hybrid multiscale CNN-Transformer architecture, food aware loss functions, systematic cultural bias mitigation, and mobile first design for deployment ready optimization.

3.2 Multi-Stage Transfer Learning Framework
The multistage transfer learning framework begins with a foundation in EfficientNetlite0, optimized for mobile deployment and pretrained on ImageNet for robust feature extraction and efficiency (Tan & Le, 2019). The second stage involves finetuning large food datasets, such as Food101, Nutrition5k, and Recipe1M, to learn foodspecific visual patterns and textures (Bossard et al., 2014; Thames et al., 2021). The third stage adapts the model to African cuisine through synthetic food generation and culturally aware data augmentation, including hue, perspective, elastic transformation, and lighting adjustments to reflect traditional presentation styles (Dalakleidi et al., 2022). The final stage specialized the model for Ghanaian foods using progressive finetuning on the FRANI dataset, with staged unfreezing and learning rate schedules to optimize adaptation (Gelli et al., 2024).

3.3 Advanced Hybrid Architecture Design
The GhanaSegNet architecture employs a hybrid CNN-transformer design that integrates multiresolution encoding and cross scale attention fusion, enabling the robust segmentation of complex food boundaries (Xie et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022). The feature pyramid network incorporates food specific attention modules to enhance boundary preservation and segmentation accuracy (Ronneberger et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2018).


3.4 Advanced Loss Function Design
The loss function design in GhanaSegNet combines Dice, Boundary, Focal, and Contour losses with food specific class weights to optimize segmentation for irregular boundaries and class imbalance (Kervadec et al., 2019; Isensee et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2021). Cultural bias mitigation loss penalizes models that favor international foods over traditional Ghanaian dishes, ensuring balanced performance across cultural categories (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018).

3.5 Comprehensive Training Strategy
The training strategy employs progressive multiresolution training, adapting resolution, augmentation, and unfreezing strategies for robust learning and generalization (Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019). Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from large transformer models to efficient mobileready architectures, thereby supporting deployment in resource constrained environments (Hinton et al., 2015; Pak et al., 2024).

3.6 Dataset and Preprocessing Strategy
The FRANI dataset, which contains 1,141 images (939 train, 202 validation), was enhanced using an aggressive augmentation pipeline that generated over 5,000 effective training samples. The dataset includes six categories optimized for Ghanaian nutritional assessment and was validated by expert nutritionists for cultural accuracy. Advanced photometric, geometric, and culturally aware augmentations (Buslaev et al., 2020) simulate real world food presentation, lighting, and context, further improving model robustness and generalization.

3.8 Ethical considerations and cultural validation
GhanaSegNet emphasizes cultural sensitivity: dataset augmentations and label validation were performed with input from local nutritionists. We document limitations and privacy considerations: images were collected with informed consent where required, and identifiable personal data were excluded. The cultural bias mitigation in the loss function and evaluation protocols aims to reduce disparities, but further community engagement is recommended before deploying any automated nutritional assessment tool in production.

- Figure 2: GhanaSegNet predictions vs baselines — visual comparison showing improved boundary preservation
- Figure 3: Failure cases — examples where the model confuses visually similar textures or occluded components

4.6 Limitations and Reproducibility Notes
- Environment-specific imports (e.g., torchvision → torch._dynamo → sympy) caused long import chains in some local setups during development; for full experiments we recommend a clean Colab or Docker environment matching `requirements.txt` to avoid dependency-related interruptions.
- Observed performance (mIoU ≈ 24.37%) falls short of the 30% target; recommended next steps (Section 5) include extended training, stronger food-domain pretraining, heavier class balancing, and architecture scaling.

5 Discussion and Conclusion

5.1 Key Findings
The GhanaSegNet framework demonstrates that culturally aware, multistage transfer learning and hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures provide measurable improvements for Ghanaian food segmentation. Our best runs achieved mIoU ≈ 24.37% on the FRANI validation set, outperforming standard baselines (UNet, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer-B0) in this domain. Ablation studies support the contributions of food-aware loss terms, multistage transfer, and progressive resolution training.

5.2 Interpretation
The improvements observed indicate that domain-specific adaptation (through staged finetuning on food datasets and African cuisine proxies) and loss engineering for boundaries are effective strategies when target data are limited and culturally distinct. However, the remaining gap to the 30% target suggests that (a) larger or more diverse food-domain pretraining is necessary, (b) further architecture and optimization work is required (e.g., larger transformer backbones or stronger feature fusion), and (c) dataset scale remains a bottleneck.

5.3 Practical Implications
For deployment in resource-limited settings, the GhanaSegNet approach balances accuracy with mobile-first design choices; however, practical deployment will require: model compression (quantization/distillation), on-device inference tests across representative phones, and user studies to validate usability and acceptance. The cultural bias mitigation measures reduce but do not eliminate disparities; continuous dataset expansion and stakeholder engagement are recommended.

5.4 Future Work
To bridge the gap toward 30% mIoU, we propose:

- Extended training with larger food-domain pretraining (additional datasets or self-supervised pretraining tailored to food textures)
- Stronger class-balancing strategies (oversampling rare classes, adaptive loss scaling)
- Experimentation with larger transformer backbones and targeted knowledge distillation to transfer gains to mobile-ready students
- Collection of additional labeled Ghanaian food images and community-driven validation to expand FRANI and reduce dataset bias

5.5 Conclusion
GhanaSegNet advances the state of culturally aware food segmentation by combining multistage transfer learning, hybrid CNN-Transformer designs, and food-aware loss engineering. While current results (mIoU ≈ 24.37%) do not yet reach the 30% target, the ablations and analysis indicate several clear paths forward. This work lays a reproducible and actionable foundation for future research and practical deployment of culturally relevant automated nutritional assessment tools in West Africa and similar contexts.

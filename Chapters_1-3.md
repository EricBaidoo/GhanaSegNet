# GhanaSegNet: A Hybrid Semantic Segmentation Model for Ghanaian Meals

## Chapter 1: Introduction and Problem Statement

### 1.1 Background and Motivation
Food security and nutritional assessment remain urgent challenges in developing nations, particularly in West Africa. Ghana’s rich and diverse culinary heritage features complex traditional meals that current computer vision systems struggle to recognize, largely due to Western-centric training biases. The absence of culturally-relevant AI systems perpetuates health disparities and limits the development of digital health solutions in regions where they are most needed (Aslan et al., 2020; Dalakleidi et al., 2022). Globally, automated dietary monitoring is increasingly important for public health, chronic disease management, and nutritional research (Chopra & Purwar, 2021). However, most modern AI food recognition systems are trained on Western datasets such as Food-101 and Recipe1M, resulting in significant cultural bias and excluding over 1.4 billion Africans from automated nutritional assessment technologies. This technological gap is a form of algorithmic bias, reinforcing inequities in health and technology access (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018).

### 1.2 Problem Definition and Scope
Food recognition systems for African contexts face several technical and societal challenges. Technically, there is a scarcity of labeled data for traditional African cuisines, representing less than 0.1% of existing food datasets. The presentation of traditional meals introduces complex, irregular food boundaries and texture similarities among different food types, while the spatial relationships between meal components add further contextual complexity. Additionally, computational constraints for mobile deployment in resource-limited environments and severe class imbalance between food categories and backgrounds hinder the effectiveness of these systems. Societally, the lack of automated nutritional assessment tools for 54 African countries, limited public health data collection in developing regions, and technological colonialism in AI system design and deployment result in missed opportunities for scalable mobile health interventions.

### 1.3 Research Questions and Hypotheses
This research is guided by the primary question: How can we develop a culturally-aware, multi-scale transfer learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on traditional Ghanaian foods, while remaining efficient for mobile deployment? Secondary questions include whether multi-stage transfer learning (ImageNet → Food Domain → African Cuisine → Ghanaian Foods) can outperform standard single-stage transfer, what hybrid CNN-Transformer architectural innovations best support food segmentation, how food-aware loss functions address irregular boundaries and cultural presentation styles, and what deployment strategies ensure real-world applicability in resource-constrained environments. The hypotheses posit that multi-stage transfer learning will achieve 15–25% mIoU improvement over single-stage transfer, multi-scale transformer integration will outperform single-bottleneck attention by 10–15%, food-aware loss functions will demonstrate superior boundary preservation compared to standard losses, and cultural bias analysis will reveal significant performance disparities that our approach addresses.

*Summary: GhanaSegNet aims to address both technical and societal gaps in food segmentation for African contexts, with a focus on fairness, efficiency, and real-world impact.*

## Chapter 2: Literature Review and Research Gap Analysis

### 2.0 Definition of Semantic Segmentation
Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves classifying each pixel in an image into a predefined category, thereby producing a dense, pixel-wise labeling of the entire image (Long et al., 2015; Ronneberger et al., 2015). Unlike image classification, which assigns a single label to an entire image, semantic segmentation provides detailed spatial information by distinguishing between different objects and regions within the scene. For example, in the context of Ghanaian food images, semantic segmentation enables the model to identify and delineate rice, protein, vegetables, and sauce within a single meal photograph, assigning each pixel to its respective food class. This pixel-level understanding is crucial for accurate nutritional assessment and cultural representation in automated systems.

### 2.1 Evolution of Semantic Segmentation Architectures
Semantic segmentation has evolved through several key phases. The convolutional era, spanning 2015 to 2020, saw the development of fully convolutional networks for dense prediction (Long et al., 2015), encoder-decoder architectures with skip connections such as U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015), and the DeepLab series which introduced atrous convolutions for multi-scale feature extraction (Chen et al., 2018). The attention revolution from 2020 to 2022 brought transformer-based models for image understanding (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), CNN-Transformer hybrids like TransUNet (Chen et al., 2021), and efficient transformer designs such as SegFormer (Xie et al., 2021), which achieved state-of-the-art results. More recently, the focus has shifted to efficiency, with mobile-optimized architectures like MobileNets and EfficientNet-Lite (Tan & Le, 2019), knowledge distillation for efficient model transfer (Hinton et al., 2015), and neural architecture search for balancing accuracy and efficiency. Knowledge distillation refers to the process of transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, efficient model (student), while neural architecture search is an automated method for discovering optimal model structures. Advances in transformer-based segmentation (Yu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021) and mobile optimization have enabled deployment in resource-constrained environments, but most models remain Western-centric in their training data and evaluation.

*In summary, the evolution of semantic segmentation architectures has enabled increasingly accurate and efficient models, but cultural bias in training data remains a significant challenge for global applicability.*

### 2.2 Food Image Analysis: Current State and Limitations
The analysis of food images for computer vision applications is heavily influenced by the available datasets. Food-101 (Bossard et al., 2014) contains 101 categories and 75,750 images, with 90% representing Western cuisine. Recipe1M (Salvador et al., 2017) offers over a million images paired with recipes, but is also predominantly North American and European. Nutrition5k (Thames et al., 2021) provides nutritional annotations but has limited cultural diversity, and FoodSeg103 is segmentation-focused but includes minimal African representation. Systematic reviews reveal that less than 2% of African cuisine is represented across major food datasets, leading to algorithmic bias that affects over 1.4 billion people (Chopra & Purwar, 2021; Dalakleidi et al., 2022). This bias impacts segmentation accuracy, boundary detection, and the real-world applicability of models in African contexts.

*Thus, the lack of culturally-diverse food datasets is a major barrier to fair and accurate food segmentation in African contexts.*

### 2.3 Transfer Learning in Computer Vision
Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern computer vision. Single-stage transfer learning, typically involving ImageNet pretraining, is standard for natural image tasks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), but suffers from domain gap challenges and limited adaptation when the source and target domains differ. The domain gap refers to the difference in data distribution between the source (e.g., ImageNet) and target (e.g., Ghanaian food images) domains, which can lead to reduced model performance. Multi-stage transfer learning, as proposed in this work, involves progressive domain adaptation from ImageNet to food domain, then to cultural specificity and finally to the target application. Each stage refines hierarchical features and improves generalization, especially when handling limited target data (Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Tan & Le, 2019). Hierarchical features are representations learned at multiple levels of abstraction, from simple edges to complex objects. Self-supervised learning approaches, including contrastive learning (SimCLR, SwAV), masked image modeling (MAE, BEiT), and multi-modal learning for recipe-image alignment, further enhance the ability to learn robust representations for food imagery.

*In summary, multi-stage transfer learning and self-supervised approaches offer promising solutions for adapting models to culturally-specific food segmentation tasks.*

### 2.4 Mobile Deployment and Edge Computing
Mobile deployment of segmentation models requires careful consideration of efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Techniques such as model compression (quantization, pruning, distillation), architecture optimization for mobile-specific designs, and hardware awareness (ARM optimization, edge TPU compatibility) are essential. Quantization reduces model size and speeds up inference by representing weights with lower precision, while pruning removes unnecessary parameters. In developing regions, deployment is challenged by limited processing power, memory, and battery life, as well as the need for offline capability and cultural adaptation, including local language support and sensitivity to cultural context.

*To conclude the literature review, addressing efficiency and cultural adaptation is critical for real-world deployment of segmentation models in African contexts.*

*Summary: Existing literature highlights the lack of African representation in food datasets and models, and the need for culturally-aware, efficient segmentation frameworks for real-world deployment.*

## Chapter 3: Proposed Methodology: GhanaSegNet Framework

### 3.1 Overall Architecture Philosophy
GhanaSegNet introduces a paradigm shift from single-stage transfer learning to a multi-scale, culturally-aware framework. The approach integrates progressive domain adaptation, hybrid multi-scale CNN-Transformer architecture, food-aware loss functions, systematic cultural bias mitigation, and mobile-first design for deployment-ready optimization.

### 3.2 Multi-Stage Transfer Learning Framework
The multi-stage transfer learning framework begins with a foundation in EfficientNet-lite0, optimized for mobile deployment and pretrained on ImageNet for robust feature extraction and efficiency (Tan & Le, 2019). The second stage involves fine-tuning on large food datasets such as Food-101, Nutrition5k, and Recipe1M to learn food-specific visual patterns and textures (Bossard et al., 2014; Thames et al., 2021). The third stage adapts the model to African cuisine through synthetic food generation and culturally-aware data augmentation, including hue, perspective, elastic transform, and lighting adjustments to reflect traditional presentation styles (Dalakleidi et al., 2022). The final stage specializes the model for Ghanaian foods using progressive fine-tuning on the FRANI dataset, with staged unfreezing and learning rate schedules to optimize adaptation (Gelli et al., 2024).

### 3.3 Advanced Hybrid Architecture Design
The GhanaSegNet architecture employs a hybrid CNN-Transformer design that integrates multi-resolution encoding and cross-scale attention fusion, enabling robust segmentation of complex food boundaries (Xie et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022). The feature pyramid network incorporates food-specific attention modules to enhance boundary preservation and segmentation accuracy (Ronneberger et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2018).

### 3.4 Advanced Loss Function Design
Loss function design in GhanaSegNet combines Dice, Boundary, Focal, and Contour losses, with food-specific class weights to optimize segmentation for irregular boundaries and class imbalance (Kervadec et al., 2019; Isensee et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2021). A cultural bias mitigation loss penalizes models that favor international foods over traditional Ghanaian dishes, ensuring balanced performance across cultural categories (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018).

### 3.5 Comprehensive Training Strategy
The training strategy employs progressive multi-resolution training, adapting resolution, augmentation, and unfreezing strategies for robust learning and generalization (Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019). Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from large transformer models to efficient mobile-ready architectures, supporting deployment in resource-constrained environments (Hinton et al., 2015; Pak et al., 2024).

### 3.6 Dataset and Preprocessing Strategy
The FRANI dataset, with 1,141 images (939 train, 202 validation), is enhanced through an aggressive augmentation pipeline that generates over 5,000 effective training samples. The dataset includes six categories optimized for Ghanaian nutritional assessment and is validated by expert nutritionists for cultural accuracy. Advanced photometric, geometric, and culturally-aware augmentations (Buslaev et al., 2020) simulate real-world food presentation, lighting, and context, further improving model robustness and generalization.

---

*Summary: GhanaSegNet’s methodology combines multi-stage transfer learning, hybrid architecture, food-aware loss functions, and culturally-aware augmentation to address the unique challenges of Ghanaian food segmentation.*
